# Geyser Mapping Generator

A standalone program that generates all the necessary resources on the Java end for Geyser. This is a standalone
program that requires a development environment to use.

If you would like to use this to generate mappings, clone this repository locally and use the `Run` button in your IDE.
Once the program is done, two files should be created containing the java item and block mappings.

NOTE: This plugin uses the Fabric mappings, and if you want mappings for later versions, simply update the jar(s) in the `pom.xml`. In most scenarios, this should remain the same across versions, but some updating may need to be done when it comes to larger releases.
