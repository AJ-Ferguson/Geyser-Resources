# Geyser Resources
_Generated resources for Geyser._

A standalone program that generates all the necessary resources on the Java end for Geyser. This is a standalone
program that requires a development environment to use.

Firstly, if you would like to generate mappings, clone this repository locally.

Secondly, run this program using the `Run` button in your IDE, and mappings should be generated.

NOTE: This plugin does use NMS, and if you want mappings for later versions, simply update the jar in the `pom.xml`
and update the internal code for your specific NMS version.
